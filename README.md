The Project uses HTML and CSS.

Reflection:
Seeing as how this was the first project I've done that's required me to use HTML and CSS
extensively, I found it quite difficult at first. As time went on with the project, I
learned that a lot of the initial concepts I believed to be hard to implement were easier
than expected, and that the easier ones were much more difficult. Looking at my google
homepage versus the actual one, you can see the glaring differences, but when you're just
looking at mine, I think that the little differences are hard to spot. Overall, I believe this
project helped me gain a more firm understanding of how creating a website is and helped
me start to code more in my free time.
