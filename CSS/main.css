    Notes: 
    - I changed the font to something as close to the
    google product sans font. 
    - Also some of the colors, I went and looked at 
    the code from the google homepage website to use.
    - The two buttons below the search form would need to be
    in the same div as the search form because in order for them to
    function properly with the search form, they must be in the same div.
    - Some classes could just be ids and some of the css could be condensed
    to look a lot more neat.
    - I could have done some more to allow for the window to resize better
    when becoming smaller.
    - The last TODO I'm gonna leave alone because I feel that I shouldn't
    spend anymore time on this and move on with the TOP course since I was
    already going a bit further than what the original assignment was saying
    to do. For Example: me adding the hover effects.

    TODO:
    - Have search form hover effect still active when hovering over icons
